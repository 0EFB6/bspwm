## Screenshots
![Screenshot-of-my-rice](https://github.com/notusknot/dotfiles/blob/7f158a08780e8f8246031df5aab5574c5012f183/screenshots/rice.png)

## Installation

Dependencies:
- ```zsh``` as a shell
- ```bspwm``` as a window manager
- ```sxhkd``` as a hotkey daemon
- ```dunst``` as a notification daemon
- ```picom``` as a compositor
- ```rxvt-unicode``` as a terminal emulator
- ```polybar``` as a system bar

Obviously, if you don't want to use any of these programs for whatever reason, you don't have to install them. The install script will still apply the themes to all the other programs.

***Note**: please read the install script before running it.*
To install my dotfiles, you can use the automated install script:
- ```git clone https://github.com/notusknot/dotfiles```
- ```cd dotfiles```
- ```chmod +x install.sh```
- ```./install.sh```

If you don't trust it, you can clone the repo and manually move the files into all the proper locations. 

## Documentation

These are my configuration files for the programs listed in the [installation instructions.](#installation)

My window manager of choice is ```bspwm```. I use ot because I like how simple it is to configure while still being relatively powerfull and extensible. If you want to learn how to use it better, check out [my tutorial](https://youtu.be/_55HGnz422M) for it. To manage keybinds, I use ```sxhkd``` because it works well and was made to seamlessly integrate with bspwm.
